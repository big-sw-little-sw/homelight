/**
 * Finds which suggested directories exist under the source root, for one Configuration session. `refresh`,
 * `snapshot`, `cancel` and `close` never touch the disk and never wait for a worker thread.
 *
 * - The built-in list is parsed on the calling thread, from bytes read once per process.
 * - The user's list is read on its own thread.
 * - A run thread resolves the source root, then inspects the suggestions, [Workers.n] at a time, in list order.
 *   Paths that only the user's list names are inspected in a second batch, after that list is accepted.
 * - `snapshot` reads what the threads recorded and applies the time limits.
 *
 * Reading the user's list, and each inspection of the root or a suggestion, has five seconds from the start of
 * its disk access. A later result is refused, even when no snapshot was taken at the time limit.
 *
 * Each refresh starts a new generation. Older work stops before its next path and its results are dropped, so rows
 * show as pending until the new generation inspects them. A list that fails to read gives no suggestions.
 * Cancelling or closing drops all the session's data. The limits on threads hold for the whole process, also across
 * closed sessions ([Workers]).
